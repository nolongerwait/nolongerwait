# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub.

C/C++ Research & Development Engineer.

Now work in ByteDance(Beijing).


I have been pursuing the person and things I like and love all my life.
However, when I was at the end of my life, I realized that when I have something, I will inevitably lose something. More importantly, I cannot choose what I can get and what I lose, everything is Godâ€™s will.


One day, if someone finds that this account has not been active for years, please contact my lover and successor [@wanwan1001](https://github.com/wanwan1001) and then delete my GitHub.
